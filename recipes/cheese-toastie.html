        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is not just any cheese toastie, it's the epitome of British comfort food, elevated to aristocratic heights. Think of the <strong>finest cheeses</strong>, the most sumptuous bread, and a grilling technique passed down through generations of toastie connoisseurs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bloomer bread, thick-cut and worthy of a duke</li>
            <li>A mix of mature cheddar and stilton, because two cheeses are better than one</li>
            <li>A smear of Branston pickle, for that authentic British tang</li>
            <li>A pad of butter, because everything's better with butter</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of fresh thyme leaves, just to be fancy</li>
            <li>A dash of Worcestershire sauce, for a bit of a kick</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Layer the cheeses generously on one slice of bread, as if building a monument.</li>
            <li>Add a smear of Branston pickle, a sprinkle of thyme, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with the second slice of bread, creating a sandwich fit for a lord.</li>
            <li>Butter the outside of the bread, as one would butter up royalty.</li>
            <li>Grill to perfection, achieving a golden-brown crust and a melted cheese centre.</li>
            <li>Slice diagonally, because <strong>we're not savages</strong>, and serve on a silver platter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These recipes celebrate the best of British comfort food while adding a touch of gourmet extravagance. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
