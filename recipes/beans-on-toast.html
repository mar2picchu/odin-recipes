        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In the epic saga of quick and comforting meals, beans on toast holds a <em>legendary</em> status. Yet today, we're transforming this timeless classic from a reliable standby into a veritable feast of flavors. Picture this: the finest, most sophisticated beans and a slice of bread that's nothing short of artisanal perfection. It was a burst of inspiration in my cozy kitchen that led me down this path of culinary elevation, turning an everyday dish into a gourmet experience.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of the fanciest, most pretentious beans you can find</li>
            <li>2 slices hand-crafted, probably-overpriced sourdough bread</li>
            <li>A drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil that's so virgin, it's practically saintly</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of Himalayan pink salt, mined by yetis in the remote mountains</li>
            <li>A smattering of fresh herbs (I recommend basil, thyme, and a sprig of parsley for that je ne sais quoi)</li>
            <li>Optional: A shaving of black truffle, for when you're feeling extra fancy (or just want to show off to your dinner guests)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by toasting your bread slices to perfection. If you don't have a toaster, just hold them over an open flame and hope for the best. Remember, we're going for gourmet, not practicality.</li>
            <li>While your bread is toasting (or potentially catching fire), heat your can of pretentious beans in a pot over medium heat. Stir occasionally and whisper sweet nothings to them to enhance the flavor.</li>
            <li>Once your beans are heated through and your bread is toasted (or charred, no judgment here), it's time to assemble your masterpiece. Lay the slices of bread on a plate, and generously heap the beans on top.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with the saintly olive oil, and sprinkle with the Himalayan pink salt mined by yetis.</li>
            <li>Finish it off with a smattering of fresh herbs and the optional shaving of black truffle, if you're feeling extra.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, with a side of self-satisfaction and a glass of the most pretentious wine you can find. Enjoy your gourmet beans on toast, you culinary genius, you!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Bon app√©tit!</strong></p>
